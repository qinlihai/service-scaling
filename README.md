# Execution plan for scaling out a service

<p style="font-size: 16px">
This execution plan outlines the steps required to scale out a service written in C using containerization technology. The plan will utilize Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.

### Key Considerations for Scaling
1. Containerized Microservices: Each service is independently deployable and scalable, supporting efficient scaling of specific components.
2. Statelessness: Where possible, ensure services are stateless to simplify horizontal scaling.
3. State Management: For stateful components, use shared storage (e.g., database, Redis) for session or state management.
4. Scalability of External Dependencies: Consider the ability of message brokers, databases, and caches to scale alongside the service.
5. Load Distribution: Use load balancing strategies to distribute traffic across all instances efficiently.

### Analyze Current Service Architecture

Review the current architecture of the C service to identify performance bottlenecks such as CPU usage, memory consumption, or I/O operations. Use tools like Valgrind or GDB for debugging, and tools like perf or htop to analyze CPU/memory usage.

Identify which parts of the service will require scaling and what system resources need to be optimized.


### Containerize the Service


Ensure the C code is optimized for containerization by:

Minimizing memory usage and leaks using tools like Valgrind. Avoiding unnecessary I/O operations that could impact performance in a containerized environment. Compiling the C application statically to reduce dependency on dynamic libraries.


Ensure the C service is containerized using Docker. If the service is not containerized yet, create a Dockerfile to package the service into a container.

Sample dockerfile to containerize the service:
/template/Dockerfile


### Set Up Kubernetes Cluster

Set up a Kubernetes cluster to manage and scale the C-based service. 

Create a Kubernetes Cluster:

Use tools like [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/) to set up a non-cloud Kubernetes cluster.

You can also use cloud Kubernetes services such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and 
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS),


### Create Kubernetes Deployment for the Service

Define a Kubernetes Deployment to manage the scaling of the service by specifying the container image, resources, and number of replicas.

Sample Kubernetes Deployment YAML:
/template/service-deployment.yaml


### Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) in Kubernetes to automatically scale the number of  service pods based on resource usage (e.g., CPU or memory).

Sample HPA YAML Configuration:
/template/hpa.yaml


### Implement Load Balancing

Configure a Kubernetes Service to distribute traffic to the service pods and expose the service to external clients. Use a LoadBalancer type service to manage external traffic.

There are multiple ways to implement load balancing:

1. Use NodePort or MetalLB to handle load balancing for non-cloud environment
2. Use Nginx as an Ingress Controller or a standlone load balancer
3. Use the cloud load balancing services

Sample Kubernetes Service YAML:
/template/service-load-balancer.yanl


### Database Optimization and Scaling

Optimize and scale the database to ensure it can handle the load increase caused by the service scaling. Some strategies include:

1. Read Replicas: For databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, you can create read replicas to distribute read traffic.
2. Sharding: Splitting your database into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards).
3. Caching Layers: Implementing caching solutions like Redis or Memcached to reduce the database load.

Update your service code to include replica connections for read-heavy queries.

### Session Management
If the service handles user sessions, you may need to implement session persistence across scaled instances. Common approaches include:

Sticky Sessions: Keeping a userâ€™s session tied to the same server.

External Session Storage: Using services like Redis to store session data, allowing it to be accessed by any instance.

### Implement Monitoring and Alerts

Implement monitoring to track resource usage (e.g., CPU, memory) and application metrics (e.g., response times, errors). Use Prometheus for monitoring, along with Grafana for visualization.

Sample Prometheus Rule to Monitor CPU:
/template/prometheus-rule.yanl


### Test and Validate the Scaling Plan

Perform load testing on the scaled-out service to verify that autoscaling works as expected and the service can handle an increased load without degradation.

For example, you can use Apache JMeter for Load Testing.

Validate that scaling works correctly.
Ensure that service pods and database replicas scale appropriately to handle increased traffic.

### Deploy to Production

After successful validation, deploy the scaled service into the production environment, monitoring its performance continuously.
